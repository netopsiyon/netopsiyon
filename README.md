Hi, I’m Ali Osman Kahraman 👋

Backend systems & web architecture focused developer.
I design and maintain production-oriented PHP applications and Linux-based infrastructures.

### Focus Areas
- Backend Architecture (PHP, MySQL / MariaDB, PostgreSQL)
- Linux Systems & Server Operations
- SEO-friendly, high-performance web applications
- Custom CMS & API design (WordPress-compatible where needed)

### What I care about
- Predictable systems over hype
- Readable code over clever code
- Stability, maintainability, and long-term operation

### Writing & Projects
- Technical articles: https://www.netopsiyon.com
- Personal site & portfolio: https://www.aliosman.com.tr

If you’re reviewing this profile, repositories are intentionally limited and curated.
Each project exists to demonstrate architectural decisions, not just code samples.
