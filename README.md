Hi, I’m Ali Osman Kahraman 👋

I’m a backend developer and system-oriented web architect focused on building
production-ready PHP applications and Linux-based infrastructures.

## What I work on
- Backend architecture with PHP
- Relational databases (MySQL / MariaDB, PostgreSQL)
- Linux server operations and automation
- SEO-friendly, maintainable web platforms
- Custom CMS and API design (WordPress-compatible where needed)

## How I think
- Stability over hype
- Readable code over clever tricks
- Long-term maintainability over short-term speed

## Writing & projects
- Technical articles and real-world system notes: https://www.netopsiyon.com
- Personal site & portfolio: https://www.aliosman.com.tr

Repositories here are intentionally limited and curated.
Each project exists to demonstrate architectural decisions and production thinking,
not just isolated code snippets.
